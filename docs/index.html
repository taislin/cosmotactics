			<h2>Introduction: What is This?</h2>
			<p><b>CosmoTactics</b> is a squad-based tactical roguelike set in a gritty sci-fi universe. You are the
				commander of a Space Expeditionary Force (SEF) squad, tasked with exploring hostile alien planets.
				Navigate treacherous environments, battle a myriad of alien lifeforms, and lead your team to victory...
				or a heroic death.</p>
			<p>Inspired by classics like <b>XCOM</b> and <b>Rebelstar</b>, CosmoTactics features deep, turn-based combat
				with a unique twist: simultaneous turns.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="screen">
			<h2>Game Screen: Your Command Interface</h2>
			<p>The screen is divided into two main parts: the <strong>Game Map</strong> on the left, where the action
				happens, and the <strong>Information Panel</strong> on the right, which displays unit stats, logs, and
				interaction menus.</p>

			<h2>Core Mechanics: Understanding the Battlefield</h2>
			<h3>Simultaneous Turns: Every Decision Counts</h3>
			<p>Unlike traditional turn-based games, you don't move your entire team and then wait for the enemy. In
				CosmoTactics, you issue an order to <strong>one selected unit</strong>. Once you confirm that action
				(moving, firing, waiting), <strong>all other units on the map (both friendly and hostile) will act
					simultaneously</strong>. This makes every decision critical, as the entire battlefield can change in
				an instant.</p>

			<h3>The Squad and Stances: Cohesive Operations</h3>
			<p>You only directly control one unit at a time. The rest of your squad operates based on their assigned
				<b>Stance</b>. This is the heart of SEF squad command.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Follow</code>: (Default) The unit will attempt to follow the player-controlled unit,
					maintaining squad cohesion. They will still engage visible enemies if one gets close or if Autofire
					is enabled.</li>
				<li><code>Hold</code>: The unit will stay in its current position, creating a defensive line or holding
					a chokepoint. They will engage visible enemies if one gets close or if Autofire is enabled.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can also toggle <code>Autofire</code> for each unit using the <span class="key-char">O</span> key.
				When enabled, a unit will automatically fire at
				any visible enemy in range, whether they are in <code>Follow</code> or <code>Hold</code> stance. A unit
				with Autofire disabled will only return fire if attacked, or engage in melee if an enemy enters their
				adjacent tile.</p>

			<h3>Field of View (FOV) & Fog of War: Unveiling the Unknown</h3>
			<p>You can only see what your squad members can see. The map is covered in a fog of war.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Visible Area:</b> Brightly lit tiles are currently in a squad member's line of sight. You can see
					enemies and real-time changes here.</li>
				<li><b>Seen Area:</b> Dimly lit tiles are areas you have explored but cannot currently see. You will
					remember the terrain, but you won't see enemies moving in the shadows. Enemies in seen areas are
					hidden until they enter a visible area.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Simultaneous Projectiles: Witnessing Combat</h3>
			<p>Projectiles travel across the map in real-time, one tile at a time. While projectiles are in flight, you
				cannot issue new commands. Wait for all projectiles to resolve before planning your next move. This
				ensures clarity in the simultaneous turn system.</p>

			<h2>Unit Roster: Your Allies & Enemies</h2>
			<p>Learn about the various operatives of the Space Expeditionary Force (SEF) you can command, and the
				diverse alien lifeforms you will encounter.</p>
			<table id="unitstable"></table>
			<p class="small-text">For detailed stats explanation, refer to the <a href="#stats">Stats & Skills</a>
				section.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="stats">
			<h2>Stats & Skills: The Numbers Behind the Combat</h2>
			<p>Every unit, friendly or otherwise, is defined by a set of core statistics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Health:</b> The unit's life force. When this reaches zero, the unit is killed. Max health is
					determined by unit type.</li>
				<li><b>Armor / Defence:</b> Reduces incoming damage from attacks. This stat is primarily granted by
					suits and helmets. Damage reduction is applied directly to incoming damage.</li>
				<li><b>Attack:</b> The base damage for a unit's melee attacks (when unarmed). Weapon damage overrides
					this if a melee weapon is equipped.</li>
				<li><b>Speed:</b> Determines how frequently a unit can act. A unit with a speed of 2 can act twice as
					often as a unit with a speed of 1. All player units have a base speed of 1. Faster units get more
					actions per turn cycle.</li>
				<li><b>Morale:</b> Represents a unit's psychological resilience. Low morale (often due to taking heavy
					damage or seeing allies fall) can cause units to flee or become suppressed (future feature).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Global Resources:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Oxygen:</b> A shared resource for your squad. It depletes slowly each turn. If it reaches
					zero, your mission is a failure. Replenish with Oxygen Tanks.</li>
				<li><b>Gold:</b> Currency acquired during missions by picking up valuable items from defeated enemies or
					caches. Used for upgrades or purchases between levels (future feature).</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section id="weapons">
			<h2>Weapon Systems: Your Tools for Survival</h2>
			<p>Understanding your equipment is key to survival. Every weapon has unique stats that define its
				performance in combat. Ensure your operatives are equipped with the right tools for the job.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<strong>Weapon Stats Explained:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Type:</b> The category of the weapon (e.g., Laser Pistol, Projectile Rifle). This can
						sometimes influence effectiveness against certain enemy types.</li>
					<li><b>Damage:</b> The average damage dealt on a successful hit, before armor is applied. The actual
						damage will vary slightly per shot.</li>
					<li><b>Range:</b> The maximum number of tiles the weapon can effectively fire. Beyond this, accuracy
						drops significantly.</li>
					<li><b>Ammo:</b> The number of shots currently in the weapon / The maximum number of shots the
						weapon can hold.</li>
					<li><b>Reload:</b> The number of turns it takes to perform a full reload.</li>
					<li><b>Accuracy:</b> The base chance to hit a target. This is modified by distance (closer shots are
						more accurate).</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<table id="weaponstable"></table>

		<section id="items">
			<h2>Items & Pickups: Scavenge for Survival</h2>
			<p>During your expeditions, you will find items and equipment scattered across the environment or dropped by
				defeated enemies. Use the <span class="key-char">U</span> key
				or the GUI to interact with items on the ground when your cursor is over them.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Oxygen Tank:</b> A consumable that instantly replenishes a portion of your squad's shared
					<b>Oxygen</b> supply. Found as cylindrical canisters.
				</li>
				<li><b>Medkit (Small/Large):</b> A consumable that instantly heals a small/large amount of health for
					<b>every unit</b> in
					your squad. Appears as a red cross box.
				</li>
				<li><b>Stairs (Down):</b> Not an item, but the objective. Found at the end of each level. Move your
					whole squad near the stairs and use them to
					descend to the next, more dangerous level. Appears as a downward arrow.</li>
				<li><b>Equipment:</b> Includes various helmets and suits (e.g., EXO-Helmet, Heavy EXO-Suit) that provide
					additional Armor / Defence. These are automatically equipped if superior to current gear, or stored
					(future feature).</li>
				<li><b>Weapons:</b> New ranged and melee weapons can be found. Automatically equipped if superior.</li>
				<li><b>Credits (Gold):</b> Drops from some enemies or found in caches. Automatically added to your
					total.</li>
			</ul>

		<!-- NEW SECTION: Environmental Hazards -->
		<section id="hazards">
			<h2>Environmental Hazards: Dangers of the Alien World</h2>
			<p>Alien planets are fraught with environmental dangers that can impede your progress or harm your squad.
				Always be aware of your surroundings.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Acid Pool (<span class="key-char">~</span>):</b> Pools of corrosive alien liquid. Units standing
					in acid pools will take damage each turn. Avoid traversing them if possible.</li>
				<li><b>Rubble Pile (<span class="key-char">#</span>):</b> Piles of debris or unstable rock formations.
					These are impassable and will block movement and line of sight.</li>
				<li><b>Dense Flora:</b> (e.g., Alien Trees, Bushes) Can block movement or line of sight, providing cover
					for enemies.</li>
				<!-- Add more hazards as you implement them (e.g., toxic gas, unstable ground, traps) -->

		<!-- NEW SECTION: Strategies & Tactics -->
		<section id="tactics">
			<h2>Strategies & Tactics: Leading Your SEF Squad</h2>
			<p>CosmoTactics challenges you to think strategically. Here are some fundamental tactics to increase your
				squad's chances of survival:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Stick Together:</strong> Use the <span class="key-char">P</span> key to set non-controlled
					units to 'Follow' mode. A cohesive squad can support each other and focus fire more effectively.
					Spreading out too much can lead to isolated units being overwhelmed.</li>
				<li><strong>Use Cover & Line of Sight:</strong> Position your units behind solid obstacles (walls, large
					trees) to break enemy line of sight. Conversely, ensure your units have clear sight lines to engage
					threats.</li>
				<li><strong>Prioritize Targets:</strong> Not all enemies are created equal. Identify high-threat targets
					(e.g., ranged attackers, high-damage melee units) and focus your squad's fire to eliminate them
					quickly.</li>
				<li><strong>Manage Oxygen:</strong> Keep a constant eye on your Oxygen supply. Explore thoroughly but
					efficiently to find Oxygen Tanks. Don't linger in explored areas.</li>
				<li><strong>Leverage Autofire:</strong> For non-controlled units, 'Autofire' (<span
						class="key-char">O</span> key) can provide continuous suppression or damage. Consider turning it
					off for stealth or to conserve ammo.</li>
				<li><strong>Stance Mastery:</strong> 'Hold' stance (<span class="key-char">P</span> key) is excellent
					for creating a defensive perimeter, holding chokepoints, or setting up ambushes. Use 'Follow' for
					general exploration.</li>
				<li><strong>Check Equipment:</strong> Regularly check your squad's equipment (Info Panel: <span
						class="key-char">1</span>) to ensure they have the best gear available.</li>
			</ul>
