## üìú Features

-   **Simultaneous Turn System:** Make every decision count as all units (friendly and hostile) act concurrently after you issue an order to your selected operative.
-   **Squad Command:** Control one unit directly while the rest of your squad operates autonomously based on assigned Stances (Follow/Hold) and Autofire settings.
-   **Dynamic Environments:** Explore procedurally generated maze-like dungeons with varying terrain types and environmental hazards.
-   **Fog of War:** Uncover hidden areas and spot lurking threats using your squad's combined field of view.
-   **Resource Management:** Keep an eye on your squad's oxygen supply and scavenge for valuable gold and supplies.
-   **Diverse Roster:** Encounter various alien enemies and command different SEF Trooper archetypes, each with unique stats and equipment.
-   **Deep Mechanics:** Engage with detailed unit stats, weapon systems, and consumable items.

> [!NOTE]
> If for some reason you are using Windows 32bit, you won't be able to use the executable. You will need to follow the development steps below.

### If you want to help in the development

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/taislin/cosmotactics.git
    cd CosmoTactics
    ```

2.  **Install Server:**
    This project has no dependencies (the only real dependency is [rot.js](https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/), which is included in a minified version). All you need is a webserver, three options below:

    -   You can install Node.js from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download), then run the game on the console:

        `node server.js`

    -   If you have Python installed, you can run it with:

        `python -m http.server -b localhost 8125`

    -   Download one of the many webserver tools around (they're small executables), and put it on the main directory.

    This will start a server, usually accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8125/`. Open this URL in your web browser.

## üéÆ How to Play

CosmoTactics is fully playable using either keyboard, mouse, or a combination.

## üõ† Technologies Used

-   **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript:** Core web technologies.

-   **Neutralino.js:** Used for the executable, basically a small, self-contained browser app.
