# üó∫Ô∏è CosmoTactics Development Roadmap

Welcome to the official development roadmap for CosmoTactics! This document outlines the planned progression of the game, detailing major features and milestones on the path to the 1.0.0 release.

My goal is to build a deep, engaging squad-based tactical roguelike. The roadmap is structured into major version updates, each focusing on a core aspect of the game. Please note that minor bug-fix and balance patches (e.g., v0.3.1, v0.4.5) will be released between these major updates.
